# Introduction

The APIs and associated services are provided by the FAIR Data Informatics Laboratory at the University of California, San Diego.  Access to APIs is provided via scicrunch.org through an API Service Gateway. There are a number of APIs provided for the research community that are discussed in sections of this handbook:

* Metadata Search via Elasticsearch
  * Resource Information Network (Research Resource Identifiers - RRIDs)
  * SPARC Datasets
* InterLex Terminology
  * Search via Elasticsearch
* Knowledge Graph Services (Coming Soon to the API Gateway)
