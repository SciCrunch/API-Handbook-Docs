# API Rate Limiting

API access is rate limited per user. The 10 requests per second (rps) baseline is adequate for most applications and users. The 10 rps allows for data access, while also minimizing the risk of resource outages due to excessive service calls or requests from any single access node or user cohort. If you require a higher rate limit for your API key, please write to [info@scicrunch.org](mailto:info@scicrunch.org) including documentation of the reasons for such enhanced access. We may then grant a higher rate limit for your existing API key.&#x20;
